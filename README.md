# Dynamic Time Warping as a latency measure for ERPs
## Code for: Latency Measurement as a Region Statistic: Quantifying Latency Distances with Dynamic Time 

### How to run:
#### Step 1:
Clone the repo
```
    git clone https://github.com/tomjefferis/dynamic-time-warping-eeg.git
```
CD into the main directory and run the setup.sh script, this will download the dependencies and create the directories for results.
```
    cd /dynamic-time-warping-eeg
    ./setup.sh
```
#### Step 2:
Open MATLAB (2023b was used to create the program) and run any of the Experiments, note experiment 3's plotting functions are built in.
##### Matlab toolboxes installed:
- Parallel computing toolbox
- DSP System Toolbox
- EEGLAB
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Woody Average (Average with alignment)(not required)
