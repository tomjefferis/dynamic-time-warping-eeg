# Dynamic Time Warping as a latency measure for ERPs
## This Repo is still in development
For now most scripts will run as intended, testing a variety of latency measures against DTW methods in simulated peaks, real erps and simulated ERPs

## The simulated EEG data is generated from SEREEGA: https://github.com/lrkrol/SEREEGA?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
## Download SEREEGA and place in the root directory of this repo
