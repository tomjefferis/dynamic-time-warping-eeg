# Dynamic Time Warping as a latency measure for ERPs
## This Repo is still in development
For now most scripts will run as intended, testing a variety of latency measures against DTW methods in simulated peaks, real erps and simulated ERPs

## The real data code depends on FieldTrip, see: https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org

## The Generic ERP used for the 3d plots can be plotted using the plottest.m script
